Geonetworking interfaces to L2 (ITS-G5)\r\n```\r\n\r\nBeing in Savari i have developed their products from ground up ( from ground up) with a team of just 2 to 3 people.\r\n\r\nDuring my time, i have created highly scalable, modular, easily attachable / detachable architecture for the whole product line.\r\n\r\n## Projects:\r\n\r\n### Here are the major projects that i have worked on:\r\n\r\n```\r\n1. AnnArbor USDOT safetypilot modeldeployment\r\n2. USDOT 3.0 RSU specification implementation\r\n3. USDOT 3.1 ASD specification implementation\r\n4. USDOT 3.6 VAD specification implementation\r\n5. CAMP v2v task - I and II\r\n6. ITS WorldCongress 2014 - Demo of V2V safety applications\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Here are the list of minor projects that i have worked on:\r\n```\r\n1. CAN translator for Hyundai KIA vehicles\r\n   (Hyundai KIA format to a standard common message format)\r\n2. Econolite Cobalt and NTCIP 1202 Traffic controller\r\n   integration with the products\r\n3. Spat Visualiser for a real time SPaT and MAP message display (backend) \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Here are some of the products that i have worked on:\r\n\r\n#### 1. Savari Roadside Equipment Unit (RSU)\r\n```\r\nRSU is a device that acts as a DSRC gateway between the OBU\r\nand the infrastructure, delivering the needed informational\r\nand safety critical messages over DSRC medium. Also works\r\nas a gateway between the mobile units (OBUs) and the infrastructure.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 2. Savari Aftermarket Safety Device (ASD)\r\n```\r\nASD is an aftermarket device that can be retrofitted inside a\r\nvehicle that is meant for the already present vehicles on\r\nthe road. This can work as a stand-alone device capable\r\nof doing safety applications.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 3. Savari Vehicular Access Device (VAD)\r\n```\r\nVAD is a transmit only device that sends out Basic Safety Messages (BSM)\r\non the safety channel(172) that is used in the Ann arbor model deployment\r\ntest bed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### 4. Savari Security Framework Access Device (SFAD)\r\n```\r\nSFAD is a gateway between a single radio (one DSRC) device and the\r\nroad side equipment (RSE) for access with the infrastructure while\r\ncurrently doing the safety messages (BSM).\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Here are the list of my current opensource software works on GitHub:\r\n1.
