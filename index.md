## Projects:

### Here are the major projects that i have worked on from 2010 till date:

```
1. AnnArbor USDOT safetypilot modeldeployment
2. USDOT 3.0 RSU specification implementation
3. USDOT 3.1 ASD specification implementation
4. USDOT 3.6 VAD specification implementation
5. CAMP v2v task - I and II - 2010 to 2014
6. CAMP V2I project 2015
7. ITS WorldCongress 2014 - Demo of V2V safety applications
8. C2C CC test fest - 2016 Germany
9. ETSI ITS CMS5 Plugtest - 2016 Italy
10. Secure Over the Air (OTA) update to V2X system - 2017 North America
11. TAMPA smartcity pilot - 2017 - 2018 North America
12. NYC smartcity pilot - 2017 - 2018 North America
13. Ann Arbor safety pilot - 2017 - 2018 North America
```

### Some of the smartcity projects involved are below:

```
1. Smarcity - Tampa V2X Pilot - 2017 - 2018
2. Smartcity - NYC V2X Pilot - 2017 - 2018
```


### Here are the list of very small to minor projects that i have worked on:
```
1. CAN translator for Hyundai KIA vehicles
   (Hyundai KIA format to a standard common message format)
2. Econolite Cobalt and NTCIP 1202 Traffic controller
   integration with the products
3. Spat Visualiser for a real time SPaT and MAP message display (backend) 
```

### Here are some of the products that i have worked on:

#### 1. Savari Roadside Equipment Unit (RSU)
```
RSU is a device that acts as a DSRC gateway between the OBU
and the infrastructure, delivering the needed informational
and safety critical messages over DSRC medium. Also works
as a gateway between the mobile units (OBUs) and the infrastructure.
```

#### 2. Savari Aftermarket Safety Device (ASD)
```
ASD is an aftermarket device that can be retrofitted inside a
vehicle that is meant for the already present vehicles on
the road. This can work as a stand-alone device capable
of doing safety applications.
```

#### 3. Savari Vehicular Access Device (VAD)
```
VAD is a transmit only device that sends out Basic Safety Messages (BSM)
on the safety channel(172) that is used in the Ann arbor model deployment
test bed.
```

#### 4. Savari Security Framework Access Device (SFAD)
```
SFAD is a gateway between a single radio (one DSRC) device and the
road side equipment (RSE) for access with the infrastructure while
currently doing the safety messages (BSM).
```


### Here are the list of my current opensource software works on GitHub:
1. [libsysapi](https://github.com/DevNaga/libsysapi)
2. [golang experiments](https://github.com/DevNaga/go-by-experiments)

## Interested in:
```
1. Working with starups (thus improving my knowledge and expertise)
2. Volunteering open-source software work
```
